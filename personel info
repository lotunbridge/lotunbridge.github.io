My story begins when i was born in Port Macquarie in NSW and then moved to Rural NSW to a town called Gunnedah. I completed year 12 in 2017 at St MAry's College Gunnedah. After that i compleated an apprenticeship at Telstra as a field technican. I recived at Certificate III in telecommunications. I also recived my Open Cabling Licence with Structured cabling and Optical Fibre endorsements. Now i currently serve in the Army as a Infomation Systems Technican.
If you would have to describe me it would most likely be sporty. I currently play soccer for work and Rugby Union for GPS. I prefer to play Right Back in soccer and Second row in Rugby.

Intrest in IT
 My current intrest in IT is Cloud Computing and a little security. My intrest in IT begain in year 9 when got an A in computer studies and i thought to myself this is alright. I never expected to to start a career in IT as i thought of myself as a on the Tools kind of person. Durring my apprenticeship i relised i enjoy the IT side(Routers and clients computers) compared to the Telstra network side of the job. My current IT experience includes a Cert III in Telecommunications, and experience in Systems Administration: Outlook, Sharepoint, Windows 10, Active Directory
I chose to study at RMIT as i needed a course which i could study online and had subjects that intrested me. I am wanting to minor in Cloud when the time comes
