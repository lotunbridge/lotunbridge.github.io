 				 <li>Overview

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>For my project I will be developing an android application that will act as a place to hide files from unwanted users. Unlike the many applications already existing like this, the app will be encrypted with a erases function that occurs when three incorrect password attempts have occurred. To counter this function the app will be linked to a cloud storage.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
<p>The incentive behind developing this project is to gain knowledge in android development, python and encryption methods. In the current market there is a gap in a solution like the one this application could potentially achieve if developed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application will be an encrypted solution to hiding files from unauthorised users on their personal android devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The features of the application will include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A place where users can store files</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A multi-factor authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Self delete feature after three incorrect password attempts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A cloud solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Easy to use user interface</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea behind the application is to fill a potential gap in the market where users require a more secure way to hide sensitive files Just like the famous "calculator" app, this project will act in a similar way. There will be a multi factor authentication to protect the sensitive files for unauthorised users.</p>
<p>Another feature the application will have is an encryption on the files in the folder. This will help with protecting the sensitive files. The big difference between my project and the rest of the available apps is two features. The first feature is a self-destruct function will activate after three incorrect attempts at accessing the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three incorrect attempts the folder which holds the sensitive files will be erased from the device. Clearly this is not ideal for many of the users because yes, the data is safe from unwanted eyes but now it is gone. To combat this the files will be sent to the cloud where the user has the freedom to move their files back if need be.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tools and Technology:</strong></p>
<p>The software required for this project will include an Android development environment and OS, python as the coding language.</p>
<p>Hardware needed will be a PC for developing and a Android device however the ability to use a android emulator on a PC is an option.</p>
<p>The project will require a knowledge of python and android development, the cost of the project will be NIL since I own a Windows PC and Android device</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skills Required:</strong></p>
<p>The skills required for this project include: an understanding of Android Development and knowledge of Python</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
<p>When the project is finished it will fill a gap in the market for an application that will not only protect data but also move the data to the cloud where the owner can know that it is secure and safe from an unauthorised user.</p>
