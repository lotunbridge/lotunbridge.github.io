        		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<ul>
 				 <p>My story begins when I was born in Port Macquarie in NSW and then moved to Rural NSW to a town called Gunnedah. I completed year 12 in 2017 at St Mary’s College Gunnedah. After that I completed an apprenticeship at Telstra as a field technician. I received at Certificate III in telecommunications. I also received my Open Cabling Licence with Structured cabling and Optical Fibre endorsements. Now I currently serve in the Army as a Information Systems Technician.
If you would have to describe myself it would most likely be sporty. I currently play soccer for work and Rugby Union for GPS. I prefer to play Right Back in soccer and Second row in Rugby.

			<h1> My Interest In IT </h1>
			<p> My current interest in IT is Cloud Computing and a little security. My interest in IT began in year 9 when got an A in computer studies and I thought to myself this is alright. I never expected to start a career in IT as I thought of myself as a “on the Tools kind of person”. During my apprenticeship I realised I enjoy the IT side(Routers and clients computers) compared to the Telstra network side of the job. My current IT experience includes a Cert III in Telecommunications, and experience in Systems Administration: Outlook, SharePoint, Windows 10, Active Directory
I chose to study at RMIT as I needed a course which I could study online and had subjects that interested me. I am wanting to minor in Cloud when the time comes
